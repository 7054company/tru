For purposes of clarification, without limitation, the CCPA provides that for purposes of the disclosure requirements pertaining to the preceding 12 months, and until January 1, 2021, these disclosure requirements do not extend to:</p>

      <p>(i) personal information collected by Truecaller about a natural person in the course of the natural person acting as a job applicant to, an employee of, owner of, director of, officer of, medical staff member of, or contractor of Truecaller to the extent that the natural person’s personal information is collected and used by Truecaller solely within the context of the natural person’s role or former role as a job applicant to, an employee of, owner of, director of, officer of, medical staff member of, or a contractor of Truecaller; personal information that is collected by Truecaller that is emergency contact information of the natural person acting as a job applicant to, an employee of, owner of, director of, officer of, medical staff member of, or contractor of Truecaller to the extent that the personal information is collected and used solely within the context of having an emergency contact on file; or personal information that is necessary for Truecaller to retain to administer benefits for another natural person relating to the natural person acting as a job applicant to, an employee of, owner of, director of, officer of, medical staff member of, or contractor of Truecaller to the extent that the personal information is collected and used solely within the context of administering those benefits (“HR Exemption”), or</p>

      <p>(ii) California residents who are not acting as an employee, owner, director, officer, or contractor of a company, partnership, sole proprietorship, non-profit, or government agency (a “Business Representative”) where Truecaller holds personal information reflecting a written or verbal communication or a transaction between Truecaller and the Business Representative and the communications or transaction with Truecaller occur solely within the context of Truecaller conducting due diligence regarding, or providing or receiving a product or service to or from such company, partnership, sole proprietorship, non-profit, or government agency (“Business-to-Business Exemption”).</p>

      <p>California residents have certain rights under the CCPA as further described in this Privacy Policy. The CCPA provides that until January 1, 2021, the described rights do not extend to the HR Exemption or Business-to-Business Exemption.</p>
